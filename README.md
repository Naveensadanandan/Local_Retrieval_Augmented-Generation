# NutriChat: Local Retrieval Augmented Generation System for Nutrition Textbooks

**NutriChat** is an advanced Local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to interact with a 1200-page PDF Nutrition Textbook. This project leverages cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries based on the textbook's content.

## Project Overview

The goal of NutriChat is to enable users to query a comprehensive nutrition textbook and receive detailed, accurate answers generated by a language model. The system processes the textbook text, embeds it into numerical representations, and retrieves relevant information based on the user's query. The response is then generated using a state-of-the-art language model.

## Key Features

- **Text Processing & Embedding:** Utilizes Spacy and NLTK to preprocess and format the textbook text. The text chunks are then embedded using the `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` model for numerical representation.
- **Semantic Search:** Implements a vector search system to identify and retrieve relevant chunks of text based on the user's query, ensuring precise and relevant information retrieval.
- **Response Generation:** Constructs prompts from the retrieved text and generates responses using the Google Gemma-2B-IT language model, providing contextually accurate answers.
- **Scalable Storage:** Features an efficient storage system for managing embeddings, allowing for quick retrieval and response generation from large-scale documents.

## Installation
